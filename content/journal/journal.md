## October 2019

* Realization, that when you first arrived you were green and overeager and over excited, too focused on pleasing others and being their assistant, but then you had a rude awakening and the pendulum swung, too far in the other direction. Now you're finding a center ground.

  Is any of this intentional? Can any of this be described as possessing a degree of equanimity? Control over your opinions and emotions---the only things that are truly within your control? Or were you at the mercy of the world within like a rag on a line in a thunderstorm?

  Do you know your duty to yourself? If so, do it. That's how you become the wise person that you so toxically yearn to be, and coincidentally resolve the toxicity. If you don't, read.

  I think you know your duty to yourself.

* To not seek vicarious virtue, to create my own merit in the world.

* Faithfulness---and how it relates to my 2016--2018 issues, that:
  * I believed that, in good faith, I should be doing something other than writing, namely perform my craft as a physicist---designing and performing experiments, in which I find great pride---and that:
    * This resulted in a cognitive dissonance,
    * It solidified my duty to produce better physics, rather than writing about what I had at the moment,
    * It can't be chalked to "making excuses", perfectionism in the form of perpetual insufficiency, nor "fair weather writing"/lack of professionalism; but rather:
      * a display of integrity,
      * perceiving, but not understanding, how exactly the "publish or perish" shit rolls downhill, asking us to do the heavy lifting of writing and disincentivising the pursuit of proper, non-cargo-cultish science---that which might take years or decades to come to fruition,
      * that at the time, I was incapable of "seizing the moment" in the stoic sense, and to perform my duty---to push back against the bullshit as the Ultimate commands---but rather I shut down and avoided the problem and ostriched,
      * that the past cannot be changed, but the future can, so help me god.
  * How do you, in good faith, seize this moment which has been commanded to be wasted from higher up? How do you reconcile with this?
  * Now, 2+ years later, I, too, have stopped giving a shit---I, too, only care about "finishing" as seems to be the ultimate goal of the university and its faculty, and that now, finally, we are on the same page, and """GOOD THINGS""" might come as a result.
    * Except that I have seen the light of the Ultimate, and the darkness of evil, and that I know better. It is my duty to know better.

* When considering my behaviour this week I'm faced with a ... disappointment. I reacted with fear and aversion and lack of focus, and fell short of performing my duties, because I was in fear of my study permit extension issues. I drank and played video games in the evenings instead of doing physics as I waited for my application to be received and a submission confirmation to be issued. How can this behaviour be reconciled with the Stoic principles of acting on what is within our control and accepting what isn't? Epictetus teaches that we should have control over our state of mind in a situation like this, specifically because our state of mind is the one thing that is in factwithin our control. Does this speak to a failure on my part then?

Part of it is surely because I'm an undisciplined novice in the art of living, but is that all of it? I have a tendency to think that part of why I find this situation so peculiarly paralyzing is because of "linear thought"; that I thought that if there was some serious issue with the study permit then what is the point of doing physics --- if the premise is not achieved the next steps are pointless; that there is a terrible coldness and inhumanity to how the immigration system works: that there are a nebulous class of people by whose opinion I am "legal" in Canada or I'm not. This is indefensible as a matter of principle --- I have seen the light of day, praise the lord, and I know that no-one is or can ever be "illegal", but it is also outside of my sphere of influence. So why do I assign to it such a high degree of importance, rather than simply reciting the serenity prayer and moving on?

Is it an excuse if I say that there is a cognitive dissonance within me that causes me to sway from tranquility? That I see a fundamental error in how I react to how I'm treated; that instead of violently rebelling as my brain wants me to do, what I do is acquiesce? My moral principles want to do one thing, but I'm required to do another, in order to be able to "secure capitalistic opportunities" for the future. Thanks Obama.

I believe in opportunities and that they must be appreciated --- especially given how hard times are for me right now. So I end up with two halves of me fighting each other.

Then again, I do believe this is an excuse. As a matter of principle, my opinion and state of mind must be under my executive control. Stoicism is the philosophy for life, even a life in which everything is lost. And I haven't lost everything --- I'm grateful to still have a mind. I must hold myself to a higher standard. I must do better.

"When considering the future, remember that all situations unfold as the do regardless of how we feel about them. Our hopes and fear sway us, not the outside events."

* Nov 2, 2019

To not be buffeted around by outside events, to understand that your hopes and fears about the future are pertinent only to planning, and not to any emotional state.
To examine yourself every day, to assert that your motivations are free of fear or hope, that they are principally correct and moral.

Last week (SP renewal week) was a good test of equanimity, which you failed. In this there is a good opportunity for self improvement. You must have the courage to utilize it.

You didn't need to be. This is a gift. It is incumbent in you now to do your duty, assiduously.

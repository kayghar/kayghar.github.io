* Realization, that when you first arrived you were green and overeager and over excited, too focused on pleasing others and being their assistant, but then you had a rude awakening and the pendulum swung, too far in the other direction. Now you're finding a center ground.

  Do you know your duty to yourself? If so, do it. That's how you become the wise person that you so toxically yearn to be, and coincidentally resolve the toxicity. If you don't, read.

  I think you know your duty to yourself.

* To not seek vicarious virtue, to create my own merit in the world.

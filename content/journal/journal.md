* Realization, that when you first arrived you were green and overeager and over excited, too focused on pleasing others and being their assistant, but then you had a rude awakening and the pendulum swung, too far in the other direction. Now you're finding a center ground.

  Is any of this intentional? Can any of this be described as possessing a degree of equanimity? Control over your opinions and emotions---the only things that are truly within your control? Or were you at the mercy of the world within like a rag on a line in a thunderstorm?

  Do you know your duty to yourself? If so, do it. That's how you become the wise person that you so toxically yearn to be, and coincidentally resolve the toxicity. If you don't, read.

  I think you know your duty to yourself.

* To not seek vicarious virtue, to create my own merit in the world.

* Faithfulness---and how it relates to my 2016--2018 issues, that:
  * I believed that, in good faith, I should be doing something other than writing, namely perform my craft as a physicist---designing and performing experiments, in which I find great pride---and that:
    * This resulted in a cognitive dissonance,
    * It solidified my duty to produce better physics, rather than writing about what I had at the moment,
    * It can't be chalked to "making excuses", perfectionism in the form of perpetual insufficiency, nor "fair weather writing"/lack of professionalism; but rather:
      * a display of integrity,
      * perceiving, but not understanding, how exactly the "publish or perish" shit rolls downhill, asking us to do the heavy lifting of writing and disincentivising the pursuit of proper, non-cargo-cultish science---that which might take years or decades to come to fruition,
      * that at the time, I was incapable of "seizing the moment" in the stoic sense, and to perform my duty---to push back against the bullshit as the Ultimate commands---but rather I shut down and avoided the problem and ostriched,
      * that the past cannot be changed, but the future can, so help me god.
  * How do you, in good faith, seize this moment which has been commanded to be wasted from higher up? How do you reconcile with this?
  * Now, 2+ years later, I, too, have stopped giving a shit---I, too, only care about "finishing" as seems to be the ultimate goal of the university and its faculty, and that now, finally, we are on the same page, and """GOOD THINGS""" might come as a result.
    * Except that I have seen the light of the Ultimate, and the darkness of evil, and that I know better. It is my duty to know better.
